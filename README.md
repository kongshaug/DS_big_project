### Context and purpose
The purpose of this project is to develope a system for predicting the change in stock prices. This system is meant as a supplement to support or contradict the descision to invest in a given stock. We want to develope this system by analyzing the evolvement in the stock prices, which can indicate the overall direction of the stock price. This can be done by using Machine Learning or market analysis. We will experiment with different solutions, with the purpose of finding the best possible solution for this project.

### Questions

1. What will happen if we use previous changes in the stock prices to predict future stock price development? 
2. What can we expect from the many possible analysis methods to predict stock prices and are they at any help at all or are the changes in stock prices random?
3. What is the different result from Machine Learning vs. market analysis?

### Hypotheses

#### Null Hypotheses 

Changes in stock prices are random and it's not possible to analyze and predict the future stock price.

#### Alternative Hypotheses

It is possible to predict future stock prices by using neural networks and market analysis 

### What is in the focus of your interest?

This project will be focused on developing a system which can predict stock prices and thereby a positive or negative development of a given stock in the future. Our most important goal for the system is to predict the direction of the change, and therefor not the exact price change. 

### Why is it interesting?

If it's possible to contradict the null hypotheses this project is interesting for us, because it means that normal people without knowledge of the stock market has a possibility to make profit by using this program. 

### Which outcome do you expect from your research?

We expect that the null hypotheses is correct and thereby that it's not possible to predict the future changes in stock prices. 

### Who may be a user of the results?

If the null hypotheses is correct this project can be used to proof that it is not possible to predict the stock market, and thereby prevent people / companies spending a lot of time and resources witout profit.

If the null hypotheses is contradicted everyone can use this project to make personal profit.
